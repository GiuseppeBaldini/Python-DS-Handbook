# Python Data Science Handbook

Notes and code for ["Python Data Science Handbook"](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) by Jake VanderPlas. 

**Notes**

The original material was great but I tried to make it my own by taking notes / editing the code so any mistake / part not clear is my own fault. 

_My code may differ from the book also because some parts were deprecated. I did my best to keep it current (as of March 2019)._
