# Python Data Science Handbook

Notes and code for [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) by Jake VanderPlas. 

**Notes**

I took my own notes in order to better assimilate the material. Mistakes here are my own, praise goes to the author. 

_My code may differ from the book also because some parts were deprecated. Wherever possible, I updated the code to keep it current (as of March 2019)._
